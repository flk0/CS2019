## Move Aside

Files:

- mov

Story:

- Our operatives have recovered a new style of code protection like no other. Our experts have failed their reverse engineering and debugging efforts and suspect the executable may be impervious. However, there may be clues in the binary to other methods that would be more fruitful...

## Watch Me Move

Files:

- mov2

Story:

- Our operatives successfully cracked the previous executable and recovered an updated version that, unfortunately, does not share the same weakness. They suspect it may be possible to successfully debug the program if they could somehow make it past the mess of signals... Watch out for tricks, as passwords might be fleeting...

Hint:

- Suggest GDB. Radare2 may have issues.
